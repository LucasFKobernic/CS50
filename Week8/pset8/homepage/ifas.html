                        <h2>Work</h2>
                        <h3>At Stone Pagamentos SA I worked as Product Manager. I started with a intership and after 1 year I was hired. In this first period I managed the project to develop the second version of an internal API used to send email and sms to our customer base. The project had a great importance as it dealt with direct communication with the client. It was very devious, first I had to find out about the first version and its problems, and the best way to do this was to visit each of our customers (in this case, internal teams of the company) to hear their pain. To understand the technical part I approached the development team, which at the time were 2 developers. After raising the problems I discussed with the developers which were the best solutions. As we were a small team, I took care of the negotiations with external companies throughout the project, I managed internal conflicts due to version migration, and often technical problems. It was a period of great learning and served as a great gateway to the IT world. </h3>
